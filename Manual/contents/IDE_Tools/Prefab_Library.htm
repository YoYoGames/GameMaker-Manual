  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Prefab Library</span></h1>
  <p><span data-condition="Misc:Need_change">main image</span></p>
  <p>The <strong>Prefab Library</strong> is used to import assets from a <strong>source project</strong>. A source project from which prefabs are imported is known as a <strong>Collection</strong>.</p>
  <p>When you use an asset from the Prefab Library, that asset is <em>not copied</em> into your project, but is loaded from its source project when your game is built. This means that any changes in the original collection will also be reflected in your project.</p>
  <p data-condition="Misc:Need_change">visualise use of prefabs</p>
  <p>This allows you to use the same assets in multiple projects and have them all be updated when the source collection is updated.</p>
  <p>You can also choose to duplicate an asset into your project, at which point the asset is unlinked from its collection, meaning that it will no longer receive updates from its collection however it will be fully modifiable within the own project.</p>
  <h2>Adding Prefab Packages</h2>
  <p>Currently you can use the official <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> Asset Bundles via the Prefab Library.</p>
  <p>Open the Prefab Library via the <a href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Windows_Menu.htm">Windows menu</a> in the menu bar. When you open this for the first time, your Prefab Library will be empty.</p>
  <p>Click on Package Manager to add prefab collection packages:</p>
  <p data-condition="Misc:Need_change">adding packages</p>
  <p>This opens the <a data-xref="{title}" href="Package_Manager.htm">Package Manager</a> window with the &quot;Package source&quot; drop-down set to &quot;Prefabs&quot;. From here, you can install any of the official <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> Asset Bundles.</p>
  <p>Once installed, they will show up in your Prefab Library, from where you can navigate to any individual assets within the collections:</p>

  <h2>Using Prefab Assets</h2>
  <p>Assets from the Prefab Library can be dragged into compatible <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/The_Asset_Editors.htm">asset editors</a>. Currently, you can use assets in the following ways:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li>Use <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sprites.htm">Sprite</a> assets in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Objects.htm">The Object Editor</a>, <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sequences.htm">The Sequence Editor</a>, <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Rooms.htm">The Room Editor</a>, <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Tile_Sets.htm">The Tile Set Editor</a>, <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Particle_Systems.htm">The Particle System Editor</a></li>
    <li>Use <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sounds.htm">Sound</a> assets in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sequences.htm">The Sequence Editor</a></li>
    <li>Use <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Tile_Sets.htm">Tile Set</a> assets in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Rooms.htm">The Room Editor</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Apart from the editors mentioned above, any assets from prefab collections can be referenced in your code and they will be imported into your builds and be usable during runtime.</p>
  <h2>Prefab Library Features</h2>
  <p>The Prefab Library window is divided into the following sections:</p>
  <p><span data-condition="Misc:Need_change">sections</span></p>
  <p>The left section displays the Folder List that contains a tree view of your prefab folders. The right section displays the contents of the currently open folder (or the prefab collections if no folder is selected). The divider between these two sections can be dragged to resize the sections.</p>
  <p>The Folder List section contains the following parts:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Search Bar</strong>: This lets you search for any assets across all of the prefab collections that you have added from the <a data-xref="{title}" href="Package_Manager.htm">Package Manager</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Sort/Filter</strong>: This menu lets you switch between A-Z and Z-A sorting in both views of the Prefab Library. You can also enable Favourites so only assets that you have favourited are visible. Additionally you can filter assets by asset type, so e.g. you only see sprites, sounds, or any type of asset you&#39;re looking for.</li>
    <li><strong>View Menu</strong>: This lets you switch between the following views that affect how the Prefab Library is displayed:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Horizontal View</strong>: This is the default view. It displays the folder list on the left and the content view on the right.</li>
        <li><strong>Vertical View</strong>: This displays the folder list at the top and the content view at the bottom of the Prefab Library.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple View</strong>: This disables the folder list and only displays the content view.</li>
        <li><strong>Tree View</strong>: This disables the content view and only displays the folder list. The folder list will now also show the assets within a folder so they can be dragged for use in other editors.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Package Manager</strong>: This button opens the <a data-xref="{title}" href="Package_Manager.htm">Package Manager</a> where you can import any new prefab collections or delete ones that you have added before.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Content View contains the following parts:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Path View</strong>: This displays a hierarchy of folders that have opened. You can click on any folder to navigate back to it, or click on <span class="shortcut">&lt;</span> to navigate back to the root.</li>
    <li><strong>Switch View</strong>: This button lets you switch between the Grid and List views.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>RMB Menu</h3>
  <p>Right-clicking on any item in the Prefab Library displays the following options:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Make Favourite</strong>: Add the selected folder or asset to Favourites. Your Favourites can be viewed from the <strong>Sort/Filter</strong> menu in the Folder List section.</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicate into Project</strong>: This duplicates the selected asset into your project as a <strong>local asset</strong>. The asset becomes unlinked from its collection and is fully editable.</li>
    <li><b>Expand/Collapse All: </b>This option is available in the Folder List. It expands or collapses all the folders in the tree view.</li>
  </ul>
