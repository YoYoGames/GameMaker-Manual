  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Prefab Library</span></h1>
  <p><img class="center" src="../assets/Images/IDE Tools/Prefabs/prefab_main.png" />The <strong>Prefab Library</strong> is used to import assets from a single <strong>source project</strong> into the currently open project. A source project containing Prefab assets is known as a <strong>Collection</strong>.</p>
  <p>When you use an asset from the Prefab Library, that asset is <em>not copied</em> into your project but is simply referenced. The actual asset is only loaded from its Collection (source project) when your game is built. This means your game stays up-to-date with any changes in the Collection package without you needing to re-import any assets.</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../assets/Images/IDE Tools/Prefabs/prefab_vis.png" /></p>
  <p>This allows you to use the same assets in multiple projects and have them all be updated when the Collection is updated.</p>
  <p>You can also choose to duplicate an asset into your project, at which point the asset is unlinked from its Collection, meaning that it will no longer receive updates from its Collection however it will be fully modifiable within your project.</p>
  <h2>Adding Prefab Packages</h2>
  <p>Currently you can use the official <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> Asset Bundles via the Prefab Library.</p>
  <p>Open the Prefab Library via the <a href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Windows_Menu.htm">Windows menu</a> in the menu bar. When you open this for the first time, your Prefab Library will be empty.</p>
  <p>Click on &quot;<strong>Package Manager</strong>&quot; to add Collection packages:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../assets/Images/IDE Tools/Prefabs/package_manager.png" />This opens the <a data-xref="{title}" href="Package_Manager.htm">Package Manager</a> window with the &quot;Package source&quot; drop-down set to &quot;Prefabs&quot;. From here, you can install any of the official <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> Asset Bundles.</p>
  <p>Once installed, they will show up in your Prefab Library, from where you can navigate to any individual assets within the Collections:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../assets/Images/IDE Tools/Prefabs/prefab_packages.png" /></p>
  <h2>Using Prefab Assets</h2>
  <p><video class="center" src="../assets/Images/IDE Tools/Prefabs/prefab_usage.mp4" width="860" height="580" controls=""></video></p>
  <p>Assets from the Prefab Library can be dragged into compatible <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/The_Asset_Editors.htm">asset editors</a>. Currently, you can use assets in the following ways:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li>Use <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sprites.htm">Sprite</a> assets in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Objects.htm">The Object Editor</a>, <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sequences.htm">The Sequence Editor</a>, <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Rooms.htm">The Room Editor</a>, <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Tile_Sets.htm">The Tile Set Editor</a>, and <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Particle_Systems.htm">The Particle System Editor</a></li>
    <li>Use <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sounds.htm">Sound</a> assets in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sequences.htm">The Sequence Editor</a></li>
    <li>Use <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Tile_Sets.htm">Tile Set</a> assets in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Rooms.htm">The Room Editor</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Assets from Prefab Collections will not be visible in the Asset Browser or in the Asset Explorers from any editors. They either have to be dragged from the Prefab Library or be used in code (only when the project has a reference to the Collection, see the section below).</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"> </span> If you use assets from a Collection in your project and then delete the package for that Collection, you will get a &quot;<strong>Resource load failure</strong>&quot; error window on opening the project in the IDE and potential errors at runtime.</p>
  <h3>Referencing Prefab Assets In Code</h3>
  <p>For Prefab assets to be used in code, your project needs to have a reference to that Prefab Collection. This is done by either making use of one of its assets through the IDE, which adds a reference to the Prefab Collection in your project, or by manually adding a reference through the right-click menu in the Prefab Library (&quot;<strong>Add Collection Reference</strong>&quot;).</p>
  <p>Once your project has a reference to a Prefab Collection, you can use any assets from that Collection in your project&#39;s code. However there may be cases where either your project or other referenced Collections have assets with the same name, in which case you can target an asset from a specific Collection using the following syntax:</p>
  <p class="code_plain">::package-version::asset</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_tip.hts"> </span> You can get the package ID by clicking on a Collection in the Prefab Library window and copying it from the Inspector.</p>
  <p>You can pick and choose the details to specify using this syntax, e.g. you may specify just the package without a version, specify only the major version, or specify everything.</p>
  <p>For example, say you&#39;re trying to use <span class="inline2">spr_ui_heart</span> from <span class="inline2">io.gamemaker.uiicons</span>:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><span class="inline2">spr_ui_heart</span>: Simply writing the asset name will pull the asset from the Collection that the project has a reference to, assuming there are no name collisions with other assets in the project or other referenced Collections.</li>
    <li><span class="inline2">::uiicons::spr_ui_heart</span>: This will pull the asset from any referenced Collection that has <span class="inline2">uiicons</span> as the last part of its package ID (e.g. <span class="inline2">io.gamemaker.uiicons</span> or <span class="inline2">io.community.uiicons</span>).</li>
    <li><span class="inline2">::io.gamemaker.uiicons::spr_ui_heart</span>: This will pull specifically from the <span class="inline2">io.gamemaker.uiicons</span> package, useful in case there are multiple Collections that end with the same name.</li>
    <li><span class="inline2">::io.gamemaker.uiicons-1::spr_ui_heart</span>: This will pull from a version of the Collection that has 1 as its major version, so e.g. it may pull <span class="inline2">1.0.0</span>, <span class="inline2">1.0.3</span> or <span class="inline2">1.2.0</span> etc.</li>
    <li><span class="inline2">::io.gamemaker.uiicons-1.0.3::spr_ui_heart</span>: This specifies the full package ID and version to ensure there are no possible name collisions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that your project <strong>must</strong> have a reference to the version of the Collection you are trying to pull from. If the specified asset is not found in the specified Collection, you will get a compile error.</p>
  <h3>Referencing Code Symbols</h3>
  <p>Scripts included in Prefab Collections may export <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Variables/Constants.htm">Enums</a>, <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Variables/Constants.htm">Macros</a> and <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Script_Functions.htm">Script Functions</a> using the following syntax:</p>
  <p class="code">#export symbol1,symbol2,symbol3,...</p>
  <p>Any project that has a reference to such a Collection can use the exported symbols in code, e.g. to make use of an Enum/Macro or call a Script Function.</p>
  <h2>Prefab Overrides</h2>
  <p>Selecting a Prefab asset will display it in <a data-xref="{title}" href="The_Inspector.htm">The Inspector</a>, where you can apply a tag to it with the <img src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Tag.png" /> button (these tags are shared with <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm">The Asset Browser</a>). This acts as an override on the asset.</p>
  <p>You can also override the following properties in the Inspector for the selected Prefab asset (which applies only to your current project):<em></em></p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li>The Texture Group setting in Sprite, Tile Set and Font assets</li>
    <li>&quot;Disable Source Sprite Export&quot; in Tile Set assets</li>
    <li>The Audio Group setting and attributes in Sound assets</li>
    <li><a data-xref="{text}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/Extensions.htm#extension_options">Extension Options</a> in Extension assets</li>
  </ul>
  <p>On overridden Prefab asset that is used in the opened project will appear with an icon over it:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../assets/Images/IDE Tools/Prefabs/prefab_override.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;" /></p>
  <h2>Prefab Library Features</h2>
  <p>The Prefab Library window is divided into the following sections:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../assets/Images/IDE Tools/Prefabs/prefab_sections.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;" />The left section displays the Folder List that contains a tree view of your Prefab Collections. The right section displays the contents of the currently open folder (or your Prefab Collections if no folder is selected). The divider between these two sections can be dragged to resize the sections.</p>
  <p>The Folder List section contains the following parts:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Search Bar</strong>: This lets you search for any assets across all of the Prefab Collections that you have added from the <a data-xref="{title}" href="Package_Manager.htm">Package Manager</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Sort/Filter</strong>: This menu gives you the following options for sorting and filtering Prefabs:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A-Z</strong>/<strong>Z-A</strong>: Change the alphabetical sorting of Collections and Prefab assets</li>
        <li><strong>Used Collections</strong>: Only show the Collections that have been used</li>
        <li><strong>Used Prefabs Only</strong>: Only show the Prefab assets that have been used</li>
        <li><strong>Overridden Prefabs Only</strong>: Only show the Prefab assets that have overridden settings</li>
        <li><strong>Recent Prefabs</strong>: Only show Prefab assets that have been used recently</li>
        <li><strong>Favourites</strong>: Only show the Prefab assets that have been favourited</li>
        <li><strong>Authors</strong>: Filter by author</li>
        <li><strong>Asset Type</strong>: Filter by asset type, so only the selected asset types are shown</li>
        <li><strong>Tags</strong>: Filter by tag</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>View Menu</strong>: This lets you switch between the following views that affect how the Prefab Library is displayed:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Horizontal View</strong>: This is the default view. It displays the folder list on the left and the content view on the right.</li>
        <li><strong>Vertical View</strong>: This displays the folder list at the top and the content view at the bottom.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple View</strong>: This disables the folder list and only displays the content view.</li>
        <li><strong>Tree View</strong>: This disables the content view and only displays the folder list. The folder list will now also show the assets within folders so they can be dragged for use in other editors.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Package Manager</strong>: This button opens the <a data-xref="{title}" href="Package_Manager.htm">Package Manager</a> where you can install any new Prefab Collections or delete the ones that you have installed.</li>
    <li><strong>Folder List</strong>: A list of folders from imported Prefab Collections. Selecting a folder here will show its contents in the Contents view if enabled. You can use the <span class="shortcut">UP</span> and <span class="shortcut">DOWN</span> arrow keys to navigate the list and <span class="shortcut">ENTER</span> to expand/collapse a folder or view its contents in the Contents view if there are no child folders.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Content View contains the following parts:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Path</strong>: This displays a hierarchy of folders that you have opened. You can click on any folder to navigate back to it or click on <span class="shortcut">&lt;</span> to navigate back to the root.</li>
    <li><strong>View Toggle</strong>: This button lets you toggle between grid and list mode for the contents.</li>
    <li><strong>Contents</strong>: Displays the assets and folders in the selected folder. Double-clicking on an asset will display its information (name, description and icon) and you can drag assets from this view into other editors in your project (such as the Object Editor, Room Editor, etc.).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The bottom bar of the window displays the number of items in the selected folder or the number of Collections if no folder is selected.</p>
  <h3>RMB Menu</h3>
  <p>Right-clicking on any item in the Prefab Library displays the following options:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Make Favourite</strong>: Add the selected folder or asset to Favourites. Your Favourites can be viewed from the <img class="icon" height="16" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ExtensionMenu.png" width="16" /> <strong>Sort/Filter</strong> menu.</li>
    <li><strong>Add/Remove Collection Reference</strong>: Add or remove a reference to this Collection in the current project. When the project has a reference to the Collection, assets from the Collection can be referenced in code.</li>
    <li><strong>Show In Inspector</strong>: Show the selected asset in <a data-xref="{title}" href="The_Inspector.htm">The Inspector</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicate into Project</strong>: This duplicates the selected asset into your project as a local asset, i.e. the asset becomes unlinked from its Collection and is fully editable as part of the current project. It will no longer be updated if there are changes to its source asset in the Collection.</li>
    <li><strong>Expand/Collapse Children</strong>: This option is available in the Folder List. It expands or collapses all folders under the selected folder.</li>
    <li><b>Expand/Collapse All: </b>This option is available in the Folder List. It expands or collapses all folders in the tree view.</li>
  </ul>
