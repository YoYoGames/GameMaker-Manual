  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">The Micro Web Server</span></h1>
  <p>This small tool&#39;s primary function is to connect to and serve files to some of the available target platforms for <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> (like the HTML5 target). It also serves files for the <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> manual when used offline.</p>
  <p>When you run a game on a target that requires the Micro Web Server, you will see a new window open as the game is served to the chosen device:</p>
  <p><img alt="Micro Web Server Window" class="center" src="../assets/Images/IDE Tools/Micro_Web_Server.png" /></p>
  <p class="note"><span class="note">NOTE</span> The first time you run a game on a target that requires the Micro Web Server, you may get a firewall alert. You should permit the web server to communicate through the firewall if this happens.</p>
  <p>When the Micro Web Server is running, you can access your game from any local device (and even remotely, if port forwarding is properly set up). Simply access your computer&#39;s local IP address through the port shown in this window, and you will be able to play your game from another device, like a mobile phone, or another computer.</p>
  <p>For example, let&#39;s say your computer&#39;s local IP address is <span class="inline2">192.168.0.110</span> (<a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-find-your-local-and-external-ip-address-5833108">read this</a> to know how to find it), and the port shown in the Micro Web Server window is <span class="inline2">51264</span>. After running the game on your computer, you would connect to <span class="inline2">192.168.0.110:51264</span> from a browser on your mobile, and play your game.</p>
  <p>The Web Server will show a certain amount of debug information related to the files that have been served, and has a button to clear this at the bottom. Beside the &quot;Clear&quot; button is the path to the root JS file for the project, while underneath that you have the <strong>Network Speed</strong> option. This is set to &quot;No Limit&quot; by default, but clicking it will open up a list of different network options:</p>
  <p><img alt="Micro Web Server Window Bandwidths" class="center" src="../assets/Images/IDE Tools/Micro_Web_Server_Bandwidths.png" />Changing this setting will also change the package <strong>Size </strong>option to the right. You can also edit this manually, in which case the Network Speed will be set to &quot;Custom&quot;. Setting it to anything other than the maximum value will effectively throttle the network transfer speed and permit you to test games in a low bandwidth environment.</p>
  <p>You can also see the list of <strong>Allowed IPs</strong> along with the <strong>Port </strong>number being used, but these cannot be edited in the Micro Web Server. They should be set instead in the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/The_Device_Manager.htm">Device Manager</a> settings for the given device target, or the <a data-xref="{text}" href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Platform_Preferences/HTML5.htm#h">HTML5 Preferences</a> when using the &quot;Default&quot; device.</p>
