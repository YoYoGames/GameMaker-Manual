  <h1>Purchasing An Asset</h1>
  <p>To purchase an asset from the Marketplace you must first be logged in to your <a href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Licencing_Information.htm">GameMaker Account</a>. Once you have created your account and logged into Marketplace, you can then browse the asset packages available. You can download <a href="https://marketplace.gamemaker.io/publishers/23/yoyo-games">official extensions</a>, or content created by other community members, and the content can be either paid or free.</p>
  <p>If you are buying an asset package for <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> then you simply have to select it from the market listings and click the &quot;<strong>Buy for [<em>price</em>]</strong>&quot; button. This will add the product to your shopping cart, and you can either proceed to the checkout or continue to browse the assets and add further purchases.</p>

  <p class="note"><b><span data-conref="../../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"> </span> </b>Assets that are Free will not be added to your cart, and instead you will simply be asked to agree to the terms of the <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="EULA" href="#">EULA</a> and then, once accepted, the asset will be added to your library.</p>
  <p>When you are ready to proceed with the payment, you can select the &quot;Cart&quot; option from the top right of the screen and you&#39;ll be taken to an overview of the products in your cart. Here you can pay through a <strong>credit card </strong>purchase or through <strong>PayPal</strong>, or modify the purchases you are making:</p>
  <p><img alt="Purchase Report" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Introduction/MP_PurchaseReport.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;" />When you have completed the payment, you will be shown a &quot;Purchase Complete&quot; screen where you can print out the receipt. You will also be sent an email with the payment confirmation details. Once you have completed a purchase (either of a free asset or a paid one), you can go back to the <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> <a href="../../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Marketplace_Menu.htm">Marketplace Menu</a> and click on the &quot;My Library&quot; menu item where you can download and install the assets you&#39;ve purchased. See the page on the <a href="Your_Marketplace_Library.htm">Library</a> for more details on how to install assets.</p>
