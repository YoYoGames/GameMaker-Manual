  <h1>Listing An Asset</h1>
  <p>The first thing you have to do before you publish an asset is to open up the marketplace in your browser and create an <strong>asset listing</strong>. You don&#39;t have to fill out all the details here yet, but we do need to give some initial information so you can at least upload a package. So, log in to your GameMaker Account, then go to the <strong>Publishers </strong>section and select the <a href="Creating_A_Publisher_Account.htm">publishing identity</a> that you created:</p>
  <p><img alt="Publisher Account" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Introduction/MP_GotoPublisher.png" />In the Marketplace window that opens, you will now be shown a list of the already uploaded assets (if any) along with a button marked &quot;<strong>+Add New Asset</strong>&quot;. This will present you with the following window:</p>
  <p><img alt="Create New Asset" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Introduction/MP_CreateAsset.png" />The <strong>Display Name </strong>is what will be shown as the name for the package on Marketplace, and the <strong>Package ID</strong> is what will be used to identify the package from <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> and within the Marketplace publisher dashboard. The Package ID must be <em>unique </em>to the asset being uploaded, and should follow reverse URL format, eg: <span class="inline">com.&lt;Company Name&gt;.&lt;PackageName&gt;</span>.</p>
  <p class="note"><b><span data-conref="../../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"> </span> </b>Assets with a publisher ID that do <em>not</em> follow the above rule, may not upload correctly!</p>
  <p>This creates the initial listing for your package, and you can now either go back to the Assets page and add further listings, or continue to fill in the <strong>Market Listing</strong> details for the new asset being added. The listings page is where you define the type of asset package being added, as well as give details of what it contains and other relevant information:</p>
  <p><img alt="Product Information" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Introduction/MP_ProductInformation.png" />Here you should fill in each of the following fields:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Primary Category</strong>: this is the type of asset that you are creating. Once you have your primary category set, you can then continue to choose further sub-categories for the sprites which will help people to find the appropriate asset when searching Marketplace.</li>
    <li><strong>Package ID</strong>: This displays the package ID for the asset being added. It cannot be changed and each ID is unique to the Market Listing being created.</li>
    <li><strong>Display Name</strong>: The name of the asset as it will be shown on the market listing page (max 255bytes).</li>
    <li><strong>Description</strong>: A short description (less than 2000 words) that describes the asset, it&#39;s functionality and possible uses.</li>
    <li><strong>Keyword</strong>: One or more words that can be used to narrow down searching to find your asset on Marketplace. These keywords should be relevant to the asset!</li>
    <li><strong>Age Rating</strong>: The age rating that should be applied to the asset, with the following criteria:</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 55px"><strong>4+</strong>: Assets in this category contain no objectionable materials.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 55px"><strong>9</strong><strong>+</strong>: Assets in this category may contain mild or infrequent occurrences of cartoon, fantasy or realistic violence, and infrequent or mild mature, suggestive, or horror-themed content which may not be suitable for children under the age of 9.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 55px"><strong>12+</strong>: Assets in this category may also contain infrequent mild language, frequent or intense cartoon, fantasy or realistic violence, and mild or infrequent mature or suggestive themes, which may not be suitable for children under the age of 12.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 55px"><strong>17+</strong>: Assets in this category may also contain: frequent and intense offensive language, frequent and intense cartoon, fantasy or realistic violence, frequent and intense mature, horror, and suggestive themes, plus sexual content, nudity, alcohol, tobacco, and drugs which may not be suitable for children under the age of 17.</li>
    <li><strong>Price</strong>: The pricing tier that your assets should be set to. Currently only <strong>Free</strong> assets can be shared, and setting a price will make users unable to acquire your asset.</li>
    <li><strong>Required Modules</strong>: Here you can select the minimum or absolute requirements for your assets to be used correctly.</li>
    <li><strong>Support Email</strong>: An email account where people can contact you for support should they have any issues with the asset.</li>
    <li><strong>Support URL</strong>: A URL where the user can receive support for the asset (ie: FAQ&#39;s, Forums, Contacts etc...)</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing URL</strong>: A URL where the user can get further information about the asset and the publisher, as well as see videos, screenshots and any other related marketing material.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy Policy URL</strong>: Should your asset require device or user data, or if the asset is designed for children, then you must supply a link to a privacy policy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Finally you will be required to supply a number of images to properly market your assets on Marketplace. An icon (200×200 <span class="inline">PNG</span>) and a feature graphic (1140×360 <span class="inline">PNG</span>), then at least one screen shot (which should be <span class="inline">PNG</span> but can be authored with the following sizes: 1280×720, 1366×768, 1600×900 or 1920×1080), and finally you have the option of adding in a video from either <strong>YouTube</strong> or <strong>Vimeo</strong>.</p>
  <p>For best practices when filing out these details and creating images, please see the following page:</p>

    <li><a href="Marketplace_Style_Guide.htm">Marketplace Style Guide</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>With all these details filled out, you can now click on &quot;Save&quot;, which will take you back to the Assets section of the publisher dashboard. You should now see that your assets are listed and you are ready to <a href="Creating_A_Marketplace_Asset.htm">upload the package</a> and publish, which is done by simply clicking the <strong>Publish vx.x.x.</strong> button:</p>
  <p><img alt="Publishing An Uploaded Asset" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Introduction/MP_Publish.png" />Note that setting up a Service Listing is slightly different to setting up an asset listing, and you can find full details from the following page:</p>
