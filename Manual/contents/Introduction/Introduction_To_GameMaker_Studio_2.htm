  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Introduction To GameMaker</span></h1>
  <p><span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> is a tool designed to empower you and your team to make new and innovative games as well as prototype ideas in the fastest and most intuitive way possible, across multiple target platforms. It is intended primarily as a tool for making 2D games - although 3D games are perfectly doable - and comes with a number of tools and editors to help you realise your dreams and ideas, with your final project being ported across multiple platforms from the same initial base resources. <img alt="The GameMaker IDE" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/MainPage.png" /></p>
  <p>For those that are new to the world of programming or who have never used any game creation tool before, <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> offers an intuitive and easy to use <strong>GML Visual</strong> interface of actions that allow you to start creating your own games very quickly using visual scripting:</p>
  <p><img alt="GML Visual Example Image" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/DnD_Example.png" /></p>
  <p>If you are a more experienced - or less visual - programmer, then you can use the proprietary scripting language <strong>GML Code </strong>to create your games:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/GML_Example.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;" />You can even combine both and mix GML Code functions with GML Visual actions, giving you a great deal of flexibility when it comes to how you write things. This is all laid out in an intuitive fashion, with different aspects of your game &quot;<strong>chaining</strong>&quot; together in the <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="IDE" href="#">IDE</a> to give you a unique and very visual representation of the workflow.</p>
  <p><span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> comes with a number of powerful tools, like a complete <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Image_Editor.htm">Image Editor</a> for creating your own <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="sprites" href="#">sprites</a> and the ability to use <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="tile sets" href="#">tile sets</a> and you can also import images that you have made in any external editor, including Spine skeleton animations and <span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Vector_Types_Supported.hts"> </span> format vector files. Once you have your images it&#39;s simply a question of assigning them to objects in the <strong>Object Editor</strong>, adding some code or GML Visual actions, and then placing instances of these objects into a game room in the <strong>Room Editor</strong>. There are also additional tools for creating <strong>Paths</strong>, <strong>Sequences </strong>, <strong>Shaders</strong> and a whole lot more. You&#39;ll find the IDE is also incredibly flexible, and it can be customised to your needs, should the default IDE setup not cover something you require, using the different <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/General_Preferences.htm">Preferences</a>.</p>
  <p>This manual will tell you all you need to know about <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> and how you can create your own games with it. However, please realise that even with a program like <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span>, designing computer games is not completely effortless - so no &quot;make me a MMORPG&quot; button here! Be aware too that there are many aspects to making games and that they are all equally important: gameplay, graphics, sounds, user interaction, etc... But, the most important aspect of all, is patience. While <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> is a powerful tool, it cannot do everything for you at the touch of a button so start small with simple examples and you will find that not only is creating games great fun, but that learning to use <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> to do it is also very rewarding!</p>
