  <h1>Create a Multiplayer Game</h1>
  <p class="note">This page will take you through the detailed steps for creating your first multiplayer game.<br />
    <br />
    For information on the Rollback system, read <a data-xref="{title}" href="Rollback_System.htm">Rollback System</a>.<br />
    <br />
    For details on all Rollback functions, read <a data-xref="{title}" href="Rollback_Functions/Rollback_Functions.htm">Rollback Functions</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Project Set-Up</h2>
  <p>Start a new project, and create a sprite for your player object. You can import an image or just create a filled square.</p>
  <p>Create two objects:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>obj_game</strong>: This will manage your multiplayer game.</li>
    <li><strong>obj_player</strong>: This will be your actual player object. Each connected player will have their own instance of this object that they can control.<br />
      <br />
      Assign your player sprite to the player object.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><img class="center_shadow" height="220" src="../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/GML/Reference/Rollback/rollback_assets.png" width="196" /></p>
  <p>Go ahead and place <strong>obj_game</strong> into a room. <strong>Don&#39;t</strong> place <strong>obj_player</strong>, as it will be created automatically.</p>
  <h2>Starting the Game</h2>
  <p>Add the Create event to <strong>obj_game</strong>, and write the following code in it:</p>
  <p class="note"><span class="note">NOTE</span> If you&#39;re using GML Visual, use the corresponding <a href="../../../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Reference/Rollback/Rollback_Actions.htm">Rollback Actions</a>.</p>
  <p class="code">rollback_define_player(obj_player);<br />
    <br />
    var _joined = rollback_join_game();<br />
    <br />
    if (!_joined)<br />
    {<br />
        rollback_create_game(2);<br />
    }
  </p>
  <p>It first defines the player object to use, and attempts to join a game using <a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_join_game.htm"><span class="inline">rollback_join_game()</span></a>. This function returns <span class="inline">true</span> if the system found a game to join (meaning you are on the correct URL).</p>
  <p>If the game could not be joined, it returns <span class="inline">false</span>. When the returned value is <span class="inline">false</span>, we call <a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_create_game.htm"><span class="inline">rollback_create_game()</span></a> to host our own game. There we specify that the game should allow a maximum of 2 players.</p>
  <p class="note"><span class="note">NOTE</span> At the moment, you can only create games for up to 4 players.</p>
  <p>The code above will create two instances of <strong>obj_player</strong> at the top-left corner of the room, but they will not yet be controllable.</p>
  <p><img class="center_shadow" height="335" src="../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/GML/Reference/Rollback/rollback_player_spawned.png" width="447" /></p>
  <h2>Moving Players</h2>
  <p>Input is managed by the Rollback system and automatically synchronised between players.</p>
  <p>In your player object, call <span class="inline"><a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_get_input.htm">rollback_get_input()</a></span> to get a struct containing all of the default inputs, which are as follows:</p>
  <p class="note"><span class="inline"><strong>left</strong>, <strong>right</strong>, <strong>up</strong>, <strong>down</strong>, <strong>Z</strong>, <strong>X</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>space</strong></span><br />
    <br />
    <em>These indicate whether the key is held.</em> <span class="inline">*<strong>_pressed</strong></span> <em>and </em><span class="inline">*<strong>_released</strong></span> <em>variants are also provided.</em>
  </p>
  <p>To define your own inputs, see <a data-xref="{title}" href="Defining_Inputs.htm">Defining Inputs</a>.</p>
  <p>Now set up the player with the following code in its Create and Step events:</p>
  <p class="code">// Create Event<br />
    move_speed = 5;<br />
    <br />
    // Step Event<br />
    var _input = rollback_get_input();<br />
    <br />
    if (_input.left) x -= move_speed;<br />
    if (_input.right) x += move_speed;<br />
    if (_input.up) y -= move_speed;<br />
    if (_input.down) y += move_speed;
  </p>
  <p>This sets up a variable with the speed of the player, and in the Step event, gets the input struct.</p>
  <p>Based on each arrow key held, it moves the instance on the corresponding axis, e.g. pressing left reduces the X, pressing up reduces the Y, and so on.</p>
  <h2>Player Locations</h2>
  <p>Before we test, let&#39;s ensure the players are created at specific locations, instead of spawning at the top-left corner of the room.</p>
  <p>In the Create event of your player object, write this:</p>
  <p class="code">if (player_id == 0)<br />
    {<br />
        x = 300;<br />
    }<br />
    else if (player_id == 1)<br />
    {<br />
        x = room_width - 300;<br />
    }<br />
    <br />
    y = room_height / 2;
  </p>
  <p><span class="inline"><a data-xref="{title}" href="Rollback_Variables/player_id.htm">player_id</a></span> is a built-in instance variable that stores the ID of the player instance.</p>
  <p>Since our game has two players, our first player will have the ID <strong>0</strong>, and the second player will have the ID <strong>1</strong>.</p>
  <p>Based on that, we are changing the initial X position of the player. The Y position is the same for both.</p>
  <p>Now run the game, and you will see both players, where you can control the first one:</p>
  <p><video class="center" src="../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/GML/Reference/Rollback/rollback_two_players_synctest.mp4" width="856" height="420" controls="" align="center"></video></p>
  <p>The second player is moving erratically on its own, which is a feature of the Rollback system. It automatically provides random values every frame for all defined inputs, as a basic form of test for your game.</p>
  <p>You can disable automatic random movement by calling <a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_use_random_input.htm"><span class="inline">rollback_use_random_input(false)</span></a>, or <a href="Defining_Inputs.htm#h1">set up your own &quot;mock&quot; input</a> for the other player.</p>
  <h2>Online Connection</h2>
  <p>Your basic multiplayer example is complete, and it&#39;s ready to be taken to the internet.</p>
  <p>By default, the system starts in <strong>Sync Test</strong> mode, which is how you test your game offline. To enable online functionality, the second argument of <span class="inline"><a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_create_game.htm">rollback_create_game()</a></span> needs to be set to <span class="inline">false</span> (which disables Sync Test).</p>
  <p class="code">// obj_game: Create event<br />
    rollback_define_player(obj_player);<br />
    <br />
    var _joined = rollback_join_game();<br />
    <br />
    if (!_joined)<br />
    {<br />
        rollback_create_game(2, false);<br />
    }
  </p>
  <p>Sign into <a href="https://gx.games">GX.games</a> and set a region in your <a href="https://gx.games/profile/account-details/">profile settings</a>.</p>
  <p>Run the game through the <strong>GX.games</strong> target. When the Rollback system begins, it creates a new &quot;room&quot;: not a GameMaker room asset, but a <strong>virtual room</strong> in which the players will play together.</p>
  <h2>Inviting Players</h2>
  <p>When your game starts, you will not see the player instances immediately. Instead, the system will wait for all players to join before starting the game.</p>
  <p class="note"><span class="tip">TIP</span> You can start the game before players have joined by calling <a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_start_game.htm"><span class="inline">rollback_start_game()</span></a>. If you call <a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_use_manual_start.htm"><span class="inline">rollback_use_manual_start()</span></a> then the game will wait for you to start it manually even after all players have joined.</p>
  <p>While waiting, you will see a &quot;<strong>Copy Share Url</strong>&quot; button below your game. Scroll down if you don&#39;t see the button.</p>
  <p><img class="center_shadow" src="../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/GML/Reference/Rollback/rollback_copy_share_url.png" />This will copy a link to your game, which you can paste into another browser window to join as the second player.</p>
  <p>You need to have both browser windows visible at the same time, otherwise the player whose window is hidden will time out and your game will end.</p>
  <p>Once both game instances have connected and synchronised, you will be able to control each player through its browser window:</p>
  <p><img class="center_shadow" src="../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/GML/Reference/Rollback/rollback_split_test.png" />You can open both windows side-by-side by dragging and resizing them.</p>
  <p>During your test you will see debug messages in the top-left corner of your game, giving you info on the state of your game. You can disable this by calling <span class="inline"><a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_display_events.htm">rollback_display_events(false)</a></span>.</p>
  <h2 id="h">Leaving a Room</h2>
  <p>Call <a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_leave_game.htm"><span class="inline">rollback_leave_game()</span></a> to make a player leave the room. Read the <a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_leave_game.htm">function page</a> for detailed information on its use.</p>
  <h2>Game Logic</h2>
  <p>The Rollback system will automatically create player instances when all players have joined, as long as you&#39;re using <a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_define_player.htm"><span class="inline">rollback_define_player()</span></a>.</p>
  <p>However it still allows you to run any other code before the game starts, meaning you must take care to only start your core game logic once all players have joined.</p>
  <p>For example, if you&#39;re spawning enemy instances using an alarm, only start that alarm once the <a data-xref="{text}" href="Rollback_Events.htm#h">Rollback Start</a> event triggers.</p>
  <h2>Major Events</h2>
  <p>Major events in your game, such as a player winning and ending the level, should be done when all players are synchronised. Otherwise, a wrong prediction might wrongly make a player win, which would appear odd when it eventually rolls back.</p>
  <p>See the example on <span class="inline"><a href="Rollback_Functions/rollback_sync_on_frame.htm">rollback_sync_on_frame()</a></span> for doing this properly.</p>
