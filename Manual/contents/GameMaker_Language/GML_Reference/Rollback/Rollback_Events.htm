  <h1>Rollback Events</h1>
  <p>There are two Rollback-related events you can find in the &quot;Other&quot; category:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/GML/Reference/Rollback/rollback_events.png" /></p>
  <h2 id="h">Rollback Start</h2>
  <p>This event is triggered when all the players are connected and the multiplayer game has started. It&#39;s also triggered when the room is later changed.</p>
  <p>Within this event, you get a struct called <span class="inline2">rollback_event_param</span> which contains all relevant values for the event:</p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Struct Member</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">num_players</span></td>
        <td>The total number of players in the game</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">player_id</span></td>
        <td>The ID of your local player (starting at 0, which initially is the host itself)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">first_start</span></td>
        <td>This is <span class="inline2">true</span> if the multiplayer game just started, or <span class="inline2">false</span> if only the room was changed</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">late_join</span></td>
        <td>This is <span class="inline2">true</span> if the player is a late joining player, or <span class="inline2">false</span> if not</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>You should only use this event in your game manager object rather than a player object, as <span class="inline2">rollback_event_param.player_id</span> will always be the ID of your main local player and NOT the ID of the player instance that the event may trigger in.</p>
  <p>For example, if you are player 0, and you catch the <strong>Rollback Start</strong> event in the instance of player 1, the <span class="inline2">player_id</span> variable will still be 0 as it indicates the ID of the local player only.</p>
  <h2 id="h1">Rollback Event</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Rollback Event</strong> event is triggered at various points throughout the game, containing a <span class="inline2">rollback_event_id</span> variable. This variable indicates what type of event has been triggered.</p>
  <p>A struct called <span class="inline2">rollback_event_param</span> is provided which contains all relevant values for the event.</p>
  <p>Any one of the following constants may be stored in <span class="inline2">rollback_event_id</span>:</p>
  <table>
    <colgroup>
      <col />
      <col />
    </colgroup>
    <tbody>
