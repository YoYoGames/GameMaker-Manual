  <h1>Collision Compatibility Mode</h1>
  <p>In the <a href="../../../../Settings/Game_Options.htm">General Game Options</a> for your project, you can enable &quot;<strong>Collision Compatibility Mode</strong>&quot; to switch to the legacy collision system. You would only need to do this if you noticed odd behaviour with collisions in your existing project(s) after upgrading to <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> 2022.1 or a newer version, which changed how collisions work.</p>

  <h2>Changes in Collisions</h2>
  <p>In the legacy collision system, all bounding box coordinates were rounded to integers and were &quot;exclusive&quot;, i.e. they would exclude the bottom-most and right-most edges of a collision mask. For example, the bounding box for a 16x16 collision mask would be generated from <span class="inline2">(0, 0)</span> to <span class="inline2">(15, 15)</span> (relative). This would work fine for instances that used only integer values for positioning and scaling, however using <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="floating point" href="#">floating point</a> values would cause unexpected behaviour and a slight disconnect between rendering and collision checking, as GameMaker would then always round the bounding box values for performing collision checks.</p>
  <p>In the current collision system, bounding box values are not rounded and are used as-is, meaning collisions are more accurate and behave as one would expect. Bounding boxes are also &quot;inclusive&quot; now, i.e. they include the bottom-most and right-most edges. For example, the bounding box for a 16x16 collision mask is now generated from <span class="inline2">(0.0, 0.0)</span> to <span class="inline2">(16.0, 16.0)</span> (relative).</p>
  <h2>Compatibility Mode</h2>
  <p>The collision changes explained above may cause some existing projects to break, which you can easily fix by enabling the <strong>Collision Compatibility Mode</strong> for such projects so the legacy collision system is used; however it is recommended to test and upgrade your collision code to work with the new system as it should allow your game to have more accurate and logical collisions.</p>
  <p>For projects that are new or do not use existing collision code, there is no need to enable this option.</p>
