  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">AudioEffectType Enum</span></h1>
  <p>This is one of the built-in <a data-xref="{text}" href="../../../../GML_Overview/Variables/Constants.htm#enumhead">Enums</a> that <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> provides. Pass a value from this Enum to <span class="inline3_func"><a data-xref="{title}" href="audio_effect_create.htm">audio_effect_create</a></span> to determine the type of audio effect that you want to create.</p>
  <p>Below is a list of audio effects that are currently available to choose from. See <a data-xref="{title}" href="AudioEffect.htm">AudioEffect Struct</a> for the parameters you can set for each effect.</p>
  <h2 id="h2">AudioEffectType.Bitcrusher</h2>
  <p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcrusher">bitcrusher</a> effect to create <strong>distortion</strong>. It does this in four steps (or <i>stages</i>), that take place in the following order: </p>
  <p class="dropspot"><em>Gain <b>→</b> Clipper <b>→</b> Sample rate reduction <b>→</b> Resolution reduction</em></p>
  <p>First the gain factor is applied to the input signal.</p>
  <p>The resulting signal is then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)">clipped</a> between -1 and 1 (essentially doing <span class="inline3_func"><a data-xref="{title}" href="../../../Maths_And_Numbers/Number_Functions/clamp.htm">clamp</a></span> on every sample). This is the first step that introduces distortion.</p>
  <p>Next, sample rate reduction reduces the quality of the audio by <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="downsampling" href="#">downsampling</a> it. This leads to distortion.</p>
  <p>Resolution reduction reduces the quality of the audio by decreasing the number of bits to represent a sample. As there are less bits to store the same value, some information is lost. This also leads to distortion.</p>
  <h2 id="h1">AudioEffectType.Delay</h2>
  <p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)">delay</a> effect, which delays the input signal by a given amount of time and mixes this delayed version with the original signal.</p>
  <h2 id="h5">AudioEffectType.Gain</h2>
  <p>This is a gain effect, which amplifies the input signal by the given gain factor.</p>
  <div data-conref="../../../../../assets/snippets/Note_Gain_Linear_dB.hts"> </div>
  <h2 id="h4">AudioEffectType.HPF2</h2>
  <p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter">high-pass filter</a> (shortened to <i>HPF</i>). A filter is used for filtering out certain frequencies.</p>
  <p>A high-pass filter lets higher frequencies pass and mutes lower frequencies. The frequency at which this happens is called the <i>cutoff</i> frequency. All frequencies below this frequency are filtered.</p>
  <p>A whistle at a high pitch is an example of a high frequency.</p>
  <h2 id="h3">AudioEffectType.LPF2</h2>
  <p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter">low-pass</a> filter (shortened to <i>LPF</i>). A filter is used for filtering out certain frequencies.</p>
  <p>A low-pass filter lets lower frequencies pass and mutes higher frequencies. The frequency at which this happens is called the <i>cutoff</i> frequency. All frequencies above this frequency are filtered.</p>
  <p>Bass and drum kicks are typically low frequencies in audio.</p>
  <h2 id="h">AudioEffectType.Reverb1</h2>
  <p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverb_effect">reverb</a> effect. It combines the original signal with a reverberated version of it. High frequencies can be <i>dampened</i> (reduced).</p>
  <p>A reverb effect is typically used to change the environment in which the audio is heard. You can configure reverb to make the environment appear anywhere between a small room and a grand hall or a vast open space.</p>
  <h2 id="h6">AudioEffectType.Tremolo</h2>
  <p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremolo_(electronic_effect)">tremolo</a> effect. It makes use of an <a data-xref="{bookmarkText}" href="AudioLFOType.htm#LFO">LFO</a> (Low-Frequency Oscillator) to modulate audio effect parameters at audio rates (as opposed to game-frame rates).</p>
  <p>A tremolo effect changes the amplitude of a sound.</p>
  <h2 id="h7">AudioEffectType.EQ</h2>
  <p>This is a Parametric EQ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_(audio)">equalizer</a>) effect. It combines multiple filters, each at a different frequency, to modify the frequency content of audio.</p>
  <p>This effect contains a high-pass, a low-pass, 4 peak EQs, a high-shelf and a low-shelf filter.</p>
  <p>Here is an example of how this allows you to control frequencies:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../../../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/GML/Reference/Audio/AudioEQExample.png" /></p>
  <h2 id="h9">AudioEffectType.PeakEQ</h2>
  <p>This filter creates a peak or a dip in the spectrum by a specified gain around a specified centre frequency.</p>
  <h2 id="h10">AudioEffectType.HiShelf</h2>
  <p>This filter passes all frequencies, but increases or reduces frequencies above the shelf frequency by a specified gain.</p>
  <h2 id="h8">AudioEffectType.LoShelf</h2>
  <p>This filter passes all frequencies, but increases or reduces frequencies below the shelf frequency by a specified gain.</p>
  <h2 id="h11">AudioEffectType.Compressor</h2>
  <p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression">compressor</a> effect. It reduces the dynamic range of the audio going into it, resulting in an output with smaller level differences.</p>
  <p>This effect performs <em>downward</em> compression, which reduces the volume of loud sounds <em>above</em> a certain threshold. The quiet sounds <em>below</em> the threshold remain unaffected.</p>
  <p>The audio channels are linked when evaluating the input signal&#39;s current level. This means that each channel will have the same gain reduction applied to it. This is done in order to prevent image shifting changing the user&#39;s localisation of positioned audio.</p>
