  <p><span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> is not just limited to the assets that you add in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm">The Asset Browser</a>. You can also add files to the project as <strong><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Included Files</span></strong> so that they can then be accessed while the game is running. These are simply files that are <em>included</em> with your game package, so you can do with them what you wish.</p>
  <p>What kinds of files you add will depend on what you want to do, but things like JSON files for data and configuration, sprites and background images, or spreadsheets are commonly used as <span data-field="title" data-format="default">Included Files</span>.</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_tip.hts"> </span> You can also add project files from other software as <span data-field="title" data-format="lower-alpha">included files</span> to your <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> project and set them to not export to any platforms (so they won&#39;t be included with builds of your game). The project files can be opened directly from within the <span data-field="title" data-format="default">Included Files</span> window and are included when you export your project (see <a data-xref="{title}" href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_File_Menu.htm">The File Menu</a>).</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"> </span> <strong>GX.games target</strong>: Any included files with the <strong>.gxzip</strong> extension are not downloaded as part of the initial runner data and can be downloaded on demand by calling the <span class="inline3_func"><a data-xref="{title}" href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Buffers/buffer_load_async.htm">buffer_load_async</a></span> function.</p>
  <h2>Adding Included Files</h2>
  <p>The simplest way to add an Included File is to drag it from your Explorer/Finder into the IDE. You will be asked to confirm whether the dragged file should be added to <strong><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Included Files</span></strong>. After pressing <strong>Yes</strong>, the <strong><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Included Files</span></strong> window will open, containing the file you just added.</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Included_Files_Popup.png" /></p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"> </span> Filenames for Included Files are case-insensitive, as they are changed to lowercase when a game package is built and any spaces are converted to underscores. However any GML functions that work on Included Files will also convert the filename argument to lowercase and replace the spaces so that the correct file can be found.</p>
  <h2>Included Files Window</h2>
  <p>Open <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm">The Asset Browser</a>&#39;s <b>Extras</b> menu <img alt="Extras Menu Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AssetMenu.png" /> (Fig. 1), to manually open the <strong><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Included Files</span></strong> window (Fig. 2):</p>
  <div class="image_columns">

  </div>
  <p>This window only shows you the <span data-field="title" data-format="default">Included Files</span> that are present in your project. To re-arrange or rename your files, you will need to edit the actual directory where these files are stored.</p>
  <p>Clicking on <strong>Open In Explorer/Finder</strong> will open the <span class="inline2"><span data-keyref="Const_IncludedFiles_FolderName">datafiles</span></span> folder in your project directory, which contains all the <span data-field="title" data-format="lower-alpha">included files</span>. You can add and remove files in this directory as you wish, and the interface in <span data-field="title" data-format="default">Included Files</span> will automatically update to reflect the structure in your <span class="inline2"><span data-keyref="Const_IncludedFiles_FolderName">datafiles</span></span> folder. Click the refresh button <img class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Included_Files_Refresh_Button.png" /> to instantly refresh the directory&#39;s contents.</p>
  <p><img alt="Included Files Example" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Included_Files_Example.png" /></p>
  <h2 id="h1">Included File Properties</h2>
  <p>Once you have added files to the editor, you can double-click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21" /> on them to open up the <strong>Included File Properties</strong><strong> </strong>in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../IDE_Tools/The_Inspector.htm">The Inspector</a>: </p>
  <p><img alt="Included Files Properties" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Included_Files_Properties.png" />This window shows the name of the file, its size on disk, and also the platforms that it should be exported to when you compile/test your game. You have buttons to select <strong>All</strong> or <strong>None</strong>, or you can go down the list and check/uncheck the targets that you want the file to be exported to.</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"> </span> The <strong>Default option for opening included files</strong> under <a data-xref="{text}" href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/General/Paths.htm#external_editors">External Editors</a> determines what action to use when a file is double-clicked <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21" />.</p>
  <h2>Right-Click Menu</h2>
  <p>Right-clicking <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" width="21" /> brings up the context menu: </p>
  <p><img alt="" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Included_Files_RMBMenu.png" /></p>
  <p>The following menu items are available anywhere you click: </p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Expand All</strong> - This expands all folders, showing all files.</li>
    <li><strong>Collapse All</strong> - This collapses all folders, hiding all files and only showing folders.</li>
    <li><strong>Select All</strong> - This selects all items and also makes them the current selection in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../IDE_Tools/The_Inspector.htm">The Inspector</a>, which can be useful if you e.g. want to change the platforms to export to for several files at once.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following options are only shown when you right-click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" width="21" /> a file: </p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Open in <span data-keyref="Code_Editor2_Name">Code Editor 2</span></strong> - Only displayed when the file is editable in the <span data-keyref="Code_Editor2_Name">Code Editor 2</span>, clicking this opens the file for editing. See <a data-xref="{title}" href="../The_Asset_Editors/The_Text_Editor.htm">Code Editor 2 (Beta)</a> for a list of compatible file types. (This option is only shown when the new <span data-keyref="Code_Editor2_Name">Code Editor 2</span> is enabled in the <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Text_Editor_2_Preferences.htm">Code Editor 2 Preferences</a>).</li>
    <li><strong>Open Properties</strong> - This opens the properties of the file in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../IDE_Tools/The_Inspector.htm">The Inspector</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Open in External Editor</strong> - This opens the file in an external editor based on its file extension, using the file associations set in the OS.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For further information on how <span data-field="title" data-format="default">Included Files</span> are stored with your game and how they are accessed, please see <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Additional_Information/The_File_System.htm">The File System</a>.</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_important.hts"> </span> When including sound files, you should ensure that the files avoid names that clash with streaming sound assets. For example, a sound asset called &quot;<strong>main_music</strong>&quot; will cause an Included File called &quot;<strong>main_music.ogg</strong>&quot; to become undefined when the project runs. This is because streamed files are also stored outside of the main project bundle, so care must be taken in these situations.</p>
  <p>You can also include <span class="inline">DLL</span> (on Windows) or <span class="inline">DyLib</span> (on macOS) files as <span data-field="title" data-format="default">Included Files</span> and then create your own custom functions to deal with them using <span class="inline3_func"><a data-xref="{title}" href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/OS_And_Compiler/external_define.htm">external_define</a></span>. These can then be used calling the <span class="inline3_func"><a data-xref="{title}" href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/OS_And_Compiler/external_call.htm">external_call</a></span> function.</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"> </span> Using <span data-field="title" data-format="default">Included Files</span> to create extra functionality in this way is incompatible with the <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Extensions.htm">Extension</a> system, as you cannot use use the <span class="inline3_func">external_*</span> functions with files added in an extension. Extensions assets already have a method of adding constants and functions.</p>
