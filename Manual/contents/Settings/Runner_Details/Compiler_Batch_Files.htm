  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Compiler Batch Files / Scripts</span></h1>
  <p>The <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> compiler allows you to place Batch files (Windows) or Shell scripts (on macOS and Linux) in your project directory, and in the directory for each extension in your project.</p>
  <h2>Placement</h2>
  <p>A script file may be placed at the root of your project directory, alongside the project&#39;s <span class="inline2">.yyp</span> file.</p>
  <p>A script file may also be placed in the directory of an extension, which may look like this: <span class="inline2">&lt;project_directory&gt;/extensions/&lt;extension_folder&gt;/</span>.</p>
  <p>The extension versions of a script file will be executed first, and its root version will be executed last. The order in which extensions are executed can&#39;t be controlled, so an extension developer must ensure that one extension&#39;s scripts don&#39;t rely on another extension&#39;s scripts.</p>
  <h2>Execution</h2>
  <p>Script files with specific names, placed in any of the directories described above, are executed at various points during the compilation process:</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"> </span> The steps in these tables are listed in the order that they are run, except for those under &quot;<strong>Platform-Specific Steps</strong>&quot;.</p>

  <h2 id="environment_variables">Environment Variables</h2>
  <p>You can retrieve the extension version and any of the extension options in the Batch files/Shell scripts: </p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li>Extension option: <span class="inline2">YYEXTOPT_&lt;ExtensionName&gt;_&lt;OptionName&gt;</span></li>
    <li>Version number: <span class="inline2">GMEXT_&lt;ExtensionName&gt;_version</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Replace <span class="inline2">&lt;ExtensionName&gt;</span> here with the name of the extension you&#39;re using.</p>
  <p>The <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> compiler also sets other variables. To get the full list you can use the <span class="inline2">set</span> command in a script on Windows and the <span class="inline2">env</span> command on Mac and Linux.</p>
  <h2>Disabling Scripts for an Extension</h2>
  <p>If you use multiple extensions that run scripts, for example, Steamworks and GDK, then you&#39;ll want to disable Steamworks when exporting to GDK, and vice versa.</p>
  <p>For that, see: <a data-xref="{title}" href="../../The_Asset_Editors/Extension_Creation/Disabling_Extensions.htm">How to Disable Extensions?</a></p>
