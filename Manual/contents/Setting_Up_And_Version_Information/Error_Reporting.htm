  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Reporting Errors</span></h1>
  <p>While great care has been taken when creating <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> to ensure that it is a stable and reliable tool, there is always the possibility that an issue could occur given the nature of the software and the multiple operating systems it runs on.</p>
  <p>Most IDE errors will be caught by <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> and you may see an error that <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> has gone &quot;unstable&quot;, which also prompts you to save your projects and then close and restart the program.</p>
  <p>If this happens, or you suspect that either the <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="Runtime" href="#">Runtime</a> or the IDE contains a bug, then we would request that you file a bug report using the <b data-stringify-type="bold">Report A GameMaker Bug</b> option from <a data-xref="{title}" href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Help_Menu.htm">The Help Menu</a>. Please always give as much information as possible and ensure you fill in every field as best you can.</p>
  <p>Please also strongly consider allowing the bug reporter to send us a copy of your project, as this may be essential to reproducing your problem - we may be unable to help if you do not provide the project. All of your files are always attached privately when you send them using the IDE bug reporter.</p>
  <h3 id="h">Report A Bug Window</h3>
  <p>The <a href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Help_Menu.htm">Help</a> -&gt; <strong>Report a GameMaker Bug</strong> option will open a window where you can create a bug report from within the IDE. If you&#39;re not signed in, a message is shown to ask you to <strong>Sign In/Register</strong>. It&#39;s also possible to <strong>Continue Anonymously</strong>.<br />
    <img class="center" src="../assets/Images/IDE_Input/Help_Menu_Report_Bug_Anonymous.png" />If you are using a <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> account, it is recommended to connect your GitHub account to your GM account via the <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/account">GameMaker Account Dashboard</a>. This will ensure your submitted reports are tied to your account, so you can add additional comments if you need to and also receive notifications from our team when the issue has been updated.
  </p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../assets/Images/IDE_Input/Help_Menu_Report_Bug_Window.png" />In the <strong>Report a Bug</strong> window you must fill the <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Description</strong>. You should also enter <strong>Steps To Reproduce</strong> the issue; however, that is optional as you may not be confident in knowing how to recreate the problem. You must assign an <strong>Issue Category</strong> and if you select a category related to building projects or in-game issues here, you will additionally be asked for the <strong>Platforms Reproduced On</strong> to say which platforms you know have this problem (and which do not).</p>
  <p>You also have the option to <b>Privately attach this project</b>, which is generally required for many kinds of bug reports. You can also attach any additional files that may help your bug report.</p>
  <p>Lastly, depending on your account subscription type, you may have the ability to set what the <strong>Issue Visibility</strong> of the bug report itself should be and therefore which bug database it is reported to.</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"> </span> All files attached via the Bug Reporter are uploaded privately and are only accessible by the <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> team (even though the bug report itself is public).</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_tip.hts"> </span> If you forgot to attach your project or any additional files with this dialog, you can use the <strong>Upload a Bug/Ticket Sample</strong> option in the <a href="../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Help_Menu.htm">Help menu</a> to upload those files and get a link that you can add to your issue.</p>
  <p>As mentioned in the window, you should first check the list of <a href="https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues">Known Issues</a> before submitting. You also have the possibility to report a <a href="https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/security/policy">security vulnerability</a>.</p>
  <p>Finally, you can submit the report by clicking the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</p>
  <h3>Crash Detected Window</h3>
  <p>In extreme cases where <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> crashes entirely, you may see on your next startup that the IDE bug reporter tells you that an earlier crash was detected and it will ask you to send us a bug report. Please do this.</p>
  <p><img alt="Crash Report Window" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Setup_And_Version/Getting_Started_Crash_Report.png" />Clicking on <strong>Report</strong> will open the <strong>Report a Bug</strong> window described above.</p>
  <p>To know exactly what data is being sent, then please see <a href="https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/wiki/Reporting-Bugs-Via-The-IDE#what-actually-gets-sent-in-a-bug-report">this article</a> on the <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> wiki.</p>
