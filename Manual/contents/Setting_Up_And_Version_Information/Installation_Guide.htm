  <h1>Installation Guide</h1>
  <p><span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> is designed for use on <strong>macOS </strong>and <strong>Windows </strong>desktop computers.</p>
  <p>You can download the <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> installer on the <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/download">GameMaker Website</a> and install it. Once installed, the first time you run <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> you may be prompted to update before being able to use the product.</p>
  <p>After any updates have been installed, you will be able to <a href="Licencing_Information.htm">log in</a> and use the IDE.</p>
  <p>It is worth noting that - depending on the licence type that you have - you may be required to install additional components or follow additional steps to set up and use <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> for specific platforms. For full information on what each platform requires, please see this article on the GameMaker Helpdesk: <a href="https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/227860547-GMS2-Required-SDKs">Required SDKs</a>.</p>
  <h2>Stable, Beta and LTS</h2>
  <p>The version you download from the <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/download">Download page</a> should be the current <strong>Stable </strong>version of <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span>. The page also has a &quot;<strong>Beta</strong>&quot; version available which is used to showcase or test new functionality before it goes into a final stable build, as well as an &quot;<strong>LTS</strong>&quot; version that gets only bug fixes.</p>
  <p>The full version details are as follows:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Stable</strong>: This version is the one you would be using for general development and is recommended for use with any commercial product. It may lack certain features available in the Beta versions, but this is because they haven&#39;t been fully tested or require additional work.</li>
    <li><strong>Beta</strong>: The Beta version of <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> is for those that wish to try out new features before they get added to the Stable build, or for those that require a coming fix for an issue. It is not recommended that you use the Beta build for final game production unless it contains an important fix for a bug that is holding up your project. You can get a Beta build of <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> from the <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/download">GameMaker Website</a>, and it can be installed and run side-by-side with the Stable build. Please note that if you are running <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> through <strong>Steam </strong>then you will not have access to the Beta build of the product using Steam itself, although you can still download and use the desktop version.</li>
    <li><strong>LTS</strong>: Long-Term Support gives you a fixed version of GameMaker that only receives bug fixes and no feature updates. This is useful for long-term commercial projects that want to avoid the changes that come with major feature additions, and only require fixes to engine bugs.</li>
  </ul>
