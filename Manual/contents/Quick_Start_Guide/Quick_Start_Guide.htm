  <h1 id="h">Quick Start Guide</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the <strong>Quick Start Guide</strong>! This section of the manual is designed to familiarise you with the most important aspects of <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> and will show you the basics to get you making games as quick as possible. The guide covers essential IDE functionality and also provides a brief introduction to programming, so you can make the most of the product as quick as possible, whether you use <span data-keyref="GML_Code">GML Code</span> or <span data-keyref="GML_Visual">GML Visual</span>.</p>
  <p>To illustrate the <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> workflow and get you straight into making something, we&#39;ve prepared the this guide to take you from the very basics of what is <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> and what is a program, through creating general assets and up to how to code basic things like movement and score.</p>
  <p>Making games with <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> is, conceptually, a fairly simple and straightforward affair, following these general steps:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li>Create <strong>image </strong>assets (<a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sprites.htm">sprites</a>, <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Tile_Sets.htm">tilesets</a>) and add them to the Asset Browser.</li>
    <li>Create <strong>object </strong>assets to represent the things you want to use in your game and assign them the required image assets.</li>
    <li>Program these objects to do things in response to <strong>events</strong>.</li>
    <li>Add <strong>instances </strong>of these objects into a <strong>room </strong>where they will perform their instructions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We&#39;ll go into the specifics of each of the above listed items in the following pages, but that&#39;s the general flow of actions required to make a game. The important thing to note here is that your main &quot;building blocks&quot; for the game will always be sprites, objects and rooms, although there are a number of subsidiary assets that can also be used to add extra functionality or behaviours to these items (like <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Sounds.htm">sounds</a>, <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Particle_Systems.htm">particles</a>, etc.).</p>
  <h2>Game Loop</h2>
  <p>Now, before we go on to explain each of these things in more detail, we&#39;ll quickly outline how <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> will turn the above building blocks into your game. Basically, everything happens in what is called the <strong>Game Loop</strong>, which has a speed measured in <strong> Frames Per Second</strong>, and one &quot;frame&quot; is called a <strong>Step </strong>in GameMaker. The <a href="../Settings/Game_Options.htm">default frames per second</a> (or <strong>FPS</strong>) is 60, meaning that for every second that passes <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> will run the game loop 60 times, and each step (loop/frame) a number of events will occur and the game will progress.</p>
  <p>To help understand this, let&#39;s imagine you have a character that you want to move around the game room. You would create a <em>sprite </em>for that character, then create an <em>object </em>and assign it the sprite, and in the object you&#39;d add an <em>event </em>called the <strong>Step Event</strong>. In this event you would tell it to move right by 2 pixels. You would then place an <strong>instance </strong>of that object into the game room, and when you run the game, the instance will start moving right by 2 pixels every step (the Step Event runs once every game step), so that in 1 second the instance has moved 120 pixels to the right.</p>
  <p>In the above example, we talk about telling the object to move to the right, but how do we do that? Well, that&#39;s done using a <strong>program </strong>which we write using either <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Index.htm">GML Visual</a> or <a data-xref="{title}" href="../GameMaker_Language/GameMaker_Language_Index.htm">GML Code</a>. Which one you use is up to you and the way you want to work, but by using them you are <em>programming </em>your game. The next section deals with this in more detail.</p>
