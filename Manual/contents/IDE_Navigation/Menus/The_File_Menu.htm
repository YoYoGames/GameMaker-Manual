  <h1>The File Menu</h1>
  <p><img alt="The File Menu" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/IDE_Input/File_Menu.png" /></p>
  <p>The file menu is where you can choose to change, save or import projects as well as set the <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> IDE preferences. The available options are:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>New Project </strong>- This option creates a new project from scratch in <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span>. It will take you to <a data-xref="{title}" href="../../Introduction/The_Start_Page.htm">The Start Page</a> to <a href="../../Introduction/The_Start_Page.htm#newproj">start a new project</a>. Choose a location to save the new project here and click <strong>Let&#39;s Go!</strong> and you&#39;ll be taken to a new, blank, <a href="../../Introduction/Workspaces.htm">workspace</a> to start working on it. Project files are saved with the <span class="inline"><strong>*<span data-keyref="Const_Ext_Project">.yyp</span></strong></span> file extension.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Project</strong> - This option opens a file explorer for you to select a previously created <span class="inline">*<span data-keyref="Const_Ext_Project">.yyp</span></span> project file for loading. Please note that on import, if the project was created using a version lower than 2.3.0, then you will get the following warning message: <img alt="Open old project warning message" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/IDE_Input/Open_OldProject_Warning.png" /> If you choose to proceed, a file explorer will be opened and you can give the project an updated name and location to save it, so the original project will not be overwritten. Once the project has been converted to the new 2.3.0+ format, it will open in the IDE and you will get a message saying that the conversion has succeeded. You should proceed to check the compatibility report that has been generated by the conversion process and see if there is anything that you need to fix before trying to run or compile the project. Note that if you get repeated errors while trying to open a project made with a version anterior to 2.3.0, then you should contact <span data-keyref="Company Name">YoYo Games</span> (using the <strong>Report a <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> Bug</strong> option from <a data-xref="{title}" href="The_Help_Menu.htm">The Help Menu</a>), supplying the original <span class="inline">*<span data-keyref="Const_Ext_Project">.yyp</span></span> file that you are trying to convert.
      <p class="note"><span data-conref="../../assets/snippets/Tag_warning.hts"> </span> A warning message is shown if <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> detects that the selected project is stored in a cloud storage location. Saving projects to cloud storage may cause problems when saving and building projects. See the <a href="https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022953052-User-Permissions-and-Internet-Access-Required-by-GameMaker#h_01GSTA4T4JBX2HHBRENJ7B56B1">Permissions Guide</a> for more information.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Import Project</strong> - Here you can import projects that have previously been exported as a <span class="inline">*<span data-keyref="Const_ExportProject_Extension">.yyz</span></span> archive (see <strong>Export Project</strong> below), or - if you have a project made with the legacy GameMaker: Studio 1.4 - you can select this option to import either the <span class="inline">*.gmx</span> or the <span class="inline">*.gmz</span> file from that product line. As with opening a project, if the <span class="inline">*<span data-keyref="Const_ExportProject_Extension">.yyz</span></span> was created with a version of <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> prior to the 2.3.0 update, then it will need converting as the project file format changed with that update.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"> </span> To import a previous <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> project into <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> it must have been created using the 1.4 version, and even then it may not work directly on import. A great many things are different between <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> and GameMaker: Studio 1.4, and so your older projects may need some tweaking for them to work. Please see the article <a href="https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/231719468-Porting-A-GMS-1-4-Game-To-GameMaker">Porting A GM:S 1.4 Game To <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span></a> on the GameMaker Knowledge Base and the section of the manual that covers <a data-xref="{title}" href="../../Additional_Information/Obsolete_Functions.htm">Obsolete Functions</a> and <a data-xref="{title}" href="../../Additional_Information/Compatibility_Scripts.htm">Compatibility Scripts</a>.</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../../assets/snippets/Tag_important.hts"> </span> Importing a <span class="inline">*<span data-keyref="Const_ExportProject_Extension">.yyz</span></span> project that contains font resources may require you to &quot;regenerate&quot; the fonts by removing/re-adding them, or by changing the font in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../../The_Asset_Editors/Fonts.htm">The Font Editor</a> and then setting it back again. This is because the existing font information is retained by the <span class="inline">*<span data-keyref="Const_ExportProject_Extension">.yyz</span></span> when it is exported, and, on import later or on another machine, the project may not have the required fonts installed already (or may have a different font of the same name). This should only be done if you are seeing issues with how the font renders after import.</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Recent Projects</strong> - You can use this option to view recently used projects. Selecting it will re-open <a data-xref="{title}" href="../../Introduction/The_Start_Page.htm">The Start Page</a> (should you have closed it) and you can select a recently used project from the list found there.</li>
    <li><strong>Save Project</strong> - This will save your game to the same location as you defined when you created the project (or where you opened it from).</li>
    <li><strong>Save Project As</strong> - Same as above, only you specify the location and the new name of the project.
      <div data-conref="../../assets/snippets/Note_Warning_Project_Saved_In_Cloud_Storage_Location.hts"> </div>
    </li>
    <li><strong><a id="exportproject"></a>Export Project </strong>- This allows you to export your project either as a file or as a template:<br />
      <img class="center" src="../../assets/Images/IDE_Input/File_Menu_Export.png" />
      <ul>
        <li><strong>YYZ</strong> - This will export the project as a single <span class="inline">*<span data-keyref="Const_ExportProject_Extension">.yyz</span></span> file and is very useful for sending copies to people or for saving backups.</li>
        <li><strong>As Template</strong> - This will allow you to export your project as a template, which you can later use as a base for other projects on <a data-xref="{title}" href="../../Introduction/The_Start_Page.htm">The Start Page</a>. Selecting this option will show you the following prompt:<br />
          <img class="center" src="../../assets/Images/IDE_Input/File_Menu_Export_Prompt.png" />You should first click on <strong>Edit Template Info</strong> to ensure that your <a href="../../Settings/Game_Options/Template_Info.htm">template information</a> is correct, and then select <strong>Export</strong> when you open this prompt a second time to save it as a template. You will then see it under the Template menu on the Start Screen.<br />
          <br />
          <span data-conref="../../assets/snippets/Custom_templates_note.hts"> </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>New IDE</strong> - When you select this a new instance of the IDE will be opened for you to use (it will open on <a data-xref="{title}" href="../../Introduction/The_Start_Page.htm">The Start Page</a>).</li>
    <li><strong>Preferences </strong>- Selecting this will take you to the <a href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences.htm">Preferences Window</a> where you can set up how <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> looks and feel.</li>
    <li><strong>Exit </strong>- Exit <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> to the desktop.</li>
