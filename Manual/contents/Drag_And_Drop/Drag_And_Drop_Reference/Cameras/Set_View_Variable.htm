  <h1><img alt="Set View Variable Icon" class="icon" src="../../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Reference/Cameras/i_Cameras_Set_View_Variable.png" /> Set View Variable</h1>
  <p>This action permits you to set certain built-in variables related to how the <b>view port</b> will display camera views of the room. You select the view port variable to edit, then give the view port to target (from 0 to 7) and finally the new value for the variable. The view port is the area of the screen that will be used to draw a given camera view (as set up in the room editor), and the different variables that you are able to set in this way are outlined in the table below:</p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">Camera</span></td>
        <td>This is for setting the viewport to show a different Camera View. You need to supply the unique ID value of the camera to change to (see <a href="../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Cameras_And_Display/Cameras_And_Viewports/Cameras_And_View_Ports.htm">here</a> for more information).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">Visibility</span></td>
        <td>This is the visibility toggle for the view port and expects a value of <span class="inline">true</span> or <span class="inline">false</span> where setting it to <span class="inline">true</span> will make the view port visible (ie: it will draw to the screen), and a value of <span class="inline">false</span> will not draw anything to the screen.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">View Port X Coordinate</span></td>
        <td>This is the X position of the view port within the game window. Note though that is is only really required when more than one view port is active - for example to create a split screen effect - and if used when only one port is active you get unexpected results.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">View Port Y Coordinate</span></td>
        <td>This is the Y position of the view port within the game window. Note though that is is only really required when more than one view port is active - for example to create a split screen effect - and if used when only one port is active you get unexpected results.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">View Port Width</span></td>
        <td>This is the width (in pixels) of the view port. The width of the view port (or combined view ports if more than one are active) define the width of the game window or background canvas at the start of the game, so changing this value after the game has started <i>will have no visible effect on the game window size</i> unless called along with the GML function <a href="../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Cameras_And_Display/The_Game_Window/window_set_size.htm"><span class="inline">window_set_size()</span></a>. Also note that if you have a larger or smaller port size than that assigned to the camera, then the camera view will be scaled down - or up - to fit.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">View Port Height</span></td>
        <td>This is the height (in pixels) of the view port. The height of the view port (or combined view ports if more than one are active) define the height of the game window or background canvas at the start of the game, so changing this value after the game has started <i>will have no visible effect on the game window size</i> unless called along with the GML function <a href="../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Cameras_And_Display/The_Game_Window/window_set_size.htm"><span class="inline">window_set_size()</span></a>.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="inline">View Port Surface ID</span></td>
        <td>With this variable you can set the contents of a given view port to draw to a surface, with the value you supply being that of the surface to use for drawing the view port to. For more information please see <a href="../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Cameras_And_Display/Cameras_And_Viewports/view_surface_id.htm">here</a>.</td>
