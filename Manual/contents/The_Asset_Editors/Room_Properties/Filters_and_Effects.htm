  <h1>Filters and Effects</h1>
  <h2>Filter/Effect Layers</h2>
  <p>In the Room Editor, you can add a new Filter/Effect layer by clicking on the <img class="icon_small" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_FX_Layer.png" /> button, which will add a new layer and open up its properties below:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Room_LayerFilterProperties.png" /></p>
  <p>A Filter/Effect (or FX) layer is used to apply a visual filter or effect to some layers. You can select an effect from the &quot;Effect Type&quot; drop-down list, which will show you its parameters in the Layer Properties window allowing you to modify how it looks and behaves.</p>
  <p>For example, selecting the &quot;Screen Shake&quot; effect will allow you to change its magnitude, shake speed and apply a sprite as its noise texture:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Room_LayerFilterParameters.png" />Adding an FX layer will apply the selected effect to all other layers that are <em>below</em> the FX layer, as demonstrated in this visual:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Room_LayerFilterEffectOrder.png" />This means that all &quot;affected&quot; layers will have the selected filter applied to them (here, &quot;Desaturate&quot;) as they are below an FX layer. Any layers above the FX layer will be unaffected. A layer may be affected by multiple effect layers that are present above it anywhere in the layer order.</p>
  <p>To create filters/effects that are applied to only one layer, see: <a href="#h">Single-Layer FX</a>.</p>
  <p class="note"><span class="note">NOTE</span> Modifying the <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/General_Layer_Functions/layer_depth.htm">depth of a layer</a> or <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Instances/Instance_Variables/depth.htm">an instance</a> at runtime may change which FX layers are applied on it, by either making its depth higher than an FX layer&#39;s depth (essentially going <em>under</em> the FX layer and being affected) or making its depth lower than an FX layer&#39;s depth (going <em>above</em> the FX layer and not being affected).</p>
  <h2 id="f_vs_x">Filter vs. Effect</h2>
  <p>A Filter only uses shaders and can be previewed in the Room Editor.</p>
  <p>An Effect also has internal code for managing itself in addition to shaders. Due to this, they can&#39;t be previewed in the Room Editor, and only appear functional at runtime (in-game).</p>
  <p>For example, &quot;<strong>Colourise</strong>&quot; is a Filter, where &quot;<strong>Windblown Particles</strong>&quot; is an Effect.</p>
  <h2>Effect Types</h2>
  <p>All the Filters and Effects in the <strong>&quot;Effect Type&quot;</strong> drop-down list are documented on this page: <a data-xref="{title}" href="FX/All_Filter_Effect_Types.htm">FX Types &amp; Parameters</a>.</p>
  <div data-conref="../../assets/snippets/FX_Limitations.hts"> </div>
  <h2 id="h">Single-Layer FX</h2>
  <p>While you can create an FX layer to apply a filter to multiple layers, you are also able to assign a filter to one specific layer only, through the <a href="../../IDE_Tools/The_Inspector.htm">Inspector</a>.</p>
  <p>Selecting a room layer will allow you to apply a filter/effect to it in the Inspector, and if that layer is a non-FX layer (e.g. Instance Layer, Asset Layer, etc.) then the effect will only be applied to that layer and not to any other layers below it.</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="../../assets/Images/IDE Tools/Inspector_Room_Layers.png" /></p>
  <p>You can also click on the <img class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Eye.png" /> icon to enable/disable the FX for the selected layer.</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../../assets/snippets/Tag_important.hts"> </span> There are some filters/effects that can <strong>only be applied to single layers</strong> (such as &quot;Blend&quot;) and will only appear for non-FX layers.</p>
  <h2>Runtime Usage</h2>
  <p>You can add and control effects at runtime using the <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/Filter_Effect_Layers/Filter_Effect_Functions.htm">Filter/Effect GML Functions</a>.</p>
