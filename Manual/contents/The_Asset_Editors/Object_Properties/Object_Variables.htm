  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Object Variables</span></h1>
  <p>When you click on the <strong>Variable Definitions </strong>button it will open up the <strong><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Object Variables</span></strong><strong> </strong>window, which you can then use to generate any number of variables <em>before </em>the Create Event is run for every new instance of the object: </p>
  <p><img alt="Object Editor Variables Window" class="center" height="284" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Object_Variables.png" width="680" />In this window you can click on the button <strong>Add </strong>to add a new variable to the list. You can then <strong>name </strong>the variable as well as set its <strong>type </strong>and adjust its <strong>properties</strong>:</p>
  <p><img alt="Object Editor New Variable" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Object_NewVariable.png" />The variable name must start with a letter and can contain only letters, numbers, and the underscore symbol <span class="inline2">_</span> with a maximum length of 64 symbols. So, valid variables are things like <span class="inline2">fish</span>, <span class="inline2">foo_bar</span>, <span class="inline2">num1</span>, and <em>invalid</em> variables would be <span class="inline2">6fish</span>, <span class="inline2">foo bar</span>, or <span class="inline2">*num</span>. Once you have given the name of the variable you need to set its type, which can be any of the following:<img alt="Object Editor Variable Types" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Object_VariableTypes.png" />It is worth noting that this feature is particularly useful when working with parent/child objects - since you can have a parent object with a set of defined variables and then simply modify them in a child object (see the section <strong>Object Variables And Child Objects</strong> below for more details) - and for when you add instances to <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Rooms.htm">The Room Editor</a> (see the section on <strong>Layers </strong>&gt; <strong>Instance Layer</strong>), since you can also modify these variables for individual instances that have been placed in the room.</p>
  <p>The different types of variable that you can create are listed below:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Real</strong>: A real number is any number that is not a whole integer and can be positive or negative. So, <span class="inline2">124.5</span>, <span class="inline2">45639.566546456</span>, <span class="inline2">0.9</span>, <span class="inline2">-45.5</span>, etc., are all examples of real numbers. All real numbers are stored as 64bit <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="floating point" href="#">floating point</a> values (doubles). The <strong>real </strong>(and <strong>integer</strong>)<strong> </strong>data types have an option for setting a range of values which can be accessed by clicking the <strong>Options</strong> <img alt="Variable Options Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_VariableOptions.png" /> button:<img alt="Object Editor Real Variable Options" class="center" height="146" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Object_RealOptions.png" width="420" />When you check this you can then input a start value and an end value and instead of having a fixed value shown for the variable in the <span data-field="title" data-format="default">Object Variables</span> window, you will have a slider that is clamped to these values:<br />
      <img alt="Object Editor Variable Range" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Object_VariableRange.png" />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Integer</strong>: An integer is a whole number and can be positive or negative, for example <span class="inline2">30004</span>, <span class="inline2">19</span>, <span class="inline2">0</span>, <span class="inline2">-300</span>. Note that you can set a range of values for the output integer, as explained above for real numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>String</strong>: A string is anything that has been placed within double quotation marks, for example &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;Hello World&quot;, or &quot;12345&quot;.</li>
    <li><strong>Boolean</strong>: A boolean is a value that is either true or false. In the <span data-field="title" data-format="default">Object Variables</span> window, this is simply shown as a box that you check for true and uncheck for false.</li>
    <li><strong>Expression</strong>: An expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain ordinary numbers, variables, strings, or <span data-keyref="GML_Code">GML Code</span> functions as well as one or more operators. For example <span class="inline2">sqrt(85 * 6) + 5.5</span> is an expression.</li>
    <li><strong>Asset</strong>: An asset is simply any one of the assets that you have defined in <a data-xref="{title}" href="../../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm">The Asset Browser</a>. When you select this variable type, you can then click on the <strong>Open Asset Explorer </strong><img alt="Open Asset Explorer Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_OpenAssetExplorer.png" width="24" /> button to open the Asset Explorer and select the asset you require. You can filter the list of assets by selecting only the desired asset types in the <strong>Options</strong> <img alt="Variable Options Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_VariableOptions.png" />.</li>
    <li><strong>List</strong>: Selecting a list type of input means that you can then create a selection of values (these can be strings, reals, expressions  etc.) of which you can then choose one or more for the variable to return. To define the items that go in the list you need to add them into the <strong>Options</strong> first (click the <img alt="Variable Options Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_VariableOptions.png" /> button):<br />
      <img alt="List Options" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Object_ListOptions.png" />You will be able to choose the item as the default value for the variable in the main window from the drop down menu:<br />
      <img alt="Object Editor List Menu" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Object_ListType.png" />Note that if you have <strong>Multi-select</strong> ticked in the List Options then the variable will become an array of all the selected options:<br />
      <img alt="List Array Options" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Object_ListArray.png" />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Colour</strong>: The colour type is for you to define a colour value to be stored in the variable. You can input a real number (from 0 to 16777216, this will have an alpha value of 255), or a hex value (in the format of <span class="inline2">$RRGGBBAA</span>), or you can double click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" /> on the colour swatch to open the <strong>Colour Picker</strong> and define the colour there.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Object Variables And Child Objects</h2>
  <p>An important feature of the <span data-field="title" data-format="default">Object Variables</span> is that they are <em>inherited </em>by any child objects that you have in the Asset Browser (see the section on <a data-xref="{title}" href="Parent_Objects.htm">Parent Objects</a> for more information), which means that you can then choose to override or change any or all of them if you wish.</p>
  <p>When you create a child object of another object asset that has variables defined for it, these will show up in the <span data-field="title" data-format="default">Object Variables</span> window like this:</p>
  <p><img alt="Object Editor Variable In A Child Object" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Object_ChildVariables.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;" />You can see in the top image that the Parent object has four Object Variables and in the bottom image these are also shown, only &quot;greyed out&quot; and have the<strong> Inherited From Parent</strong> <img alt="Inherited From Parent Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_InheritedVariable.png" /> icon to indicate that they have been inherited. These inherited variables can then be edited if you click the <strong>Override Variable</strong> <img alt="Override Variable Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_OverrideVariable.png" /> button, so you can then adjust the range slider or values, or select different items from lists, etc. Note that when you edit a parent variable <em>you can only change the defined value</em> but not the name, nor can you change the variable options. Also note that you can add in new Object Variables to child objects as well (and in the example image above you can see that &quot;Character Type&quot; is a new Object Variable only for the child object).</p>
  <p>If you have edited an inherited Object Variable, then you can click the Delete <img alt="Delete Variable Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_DeleteVariable.png" /> button to remove the edit, but not the variable. The variable will still be inherited from the parent, but will use the parent default value again. If you need to completely remove the variable, then you must do this from the parent object.</p>
  <h2 id="h">Pre-creation Code</h2>
  <p>Pre-creation code is any code generated by the compiler to initialise <span data-field="title" data-format="lower-alpha">object variables</span>. This includes the variables that you override in an instance added to the Room Editor. It runs before the Create event and before the variables in the <span class="inline2">var_struct</span> are assigned (when using <span class="inline3_func"><a data-xref="{title}" href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Instances/instance_create_depth.htm">instance_create_depth</a></span> or <span class="inline3_func"><a data-xref="{title}" href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Instances/instance_create_layer.htm">instance_create_layer</a></span>). The pre-creation code for variables that you override in the Room Editor can be found in the struct returned by <span class="inline3_func"><a data-xref="{title}" href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/room_get_info.htm">room_get_info</a></span>.</p>
  <p>This makes the order of variable initialisation in an instance as follows:</p>
  <ol class="colour">
    <li>The pre-creation code runs for the new instance, assigning it the variables set in the Variable Definitions and any overrides if it was placed in the Room Editor and variables were modified.</li>
    <li>The variables in the <span class="inline2">var_struct</span> are assigned.</li>
    <li>The Create event runs for the instance.</li>
  </ol>
