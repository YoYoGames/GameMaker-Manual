  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">The Image Editor</span></h1>
  <p><img alt="The Image Editor" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Images.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;" />The I<strong>mage Editor </strong>is where you can create your own <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="sprites" href="#">sprites</a> or edit those you have imported or created previously. If you have used any other image tools then this should be familiar to you but there are a few things to note when using the <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> Image Editor which may not be immediately apparent:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li>When you create multiple frames, you can draw to them as they animate! So, if you press the play button<img alt="Play Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ImagePlay.png" width="46" /> on the <strong>Frame Control</strong> bar, and then select a brush and start to draw in the editor window, you&#39;ll see that the frames will animate in the editor and what you draw will be added to the corresponding frame in that moment. You can experiment with different frame rates until you get something you like, but once you&#39;ve got the hang of how this works you&#39;ll be creating dynamic sprites and effects in no time.</li>
    <li>You can pull the Image Editor tab off of the main workspace window into its own window. This can be handy when using multiple monitors, for example.</li>
    <li>When you use the <em>Copy </em>functions to, for example, copy a selection of an image, then the selection copied gets added to your <strong>brush list</strong>. This means that you can select a part of an image and then use it in the rest of the paint tools to draw lines, polygons or just paint freely. The brush can be scaled and blended with a colour too. Note that the <em>Paste </em>functionality is not intended for use internally within the editor as anything you copy is added to the brush list and so can be selected for &quot;pasting&quot; that way. Instead paste is simply for you to capture something from an external program and paste it into the Image Editor.</li>
    <li>You can have multiple layers for each sprite thanks to the handy <strong>layer editor</strong>. These layers can ordered and even placed in folders to make creating more complex images easier.</li>
    <li>You can quickly change between sub-images (frames) in the editor by using the &quot;<span class="inline">1</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="inline">2</span>&quot; keys on the keyboard.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Those are just some of the more advanced features that the Image Editor offers. To find out the full feature range, please read the items below detailing the functions of every part of the editor:</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#">Frame View</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p class="dropspot">This part of the window shows the frames in the order that they will be animated in. You can click the <img alt="Add Frame Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AddArgument.png" /> button to the left to add further frames - or use the <strong>Image Menu</strong> - and you can also click and drag any of the frames to change their position along the timeline. In the top left of the Frame View you can switch on <strong>Onion Skinning</strong> <img alt="Onion Skin Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_OnionSkin.png" width="46" />, which means that in a single frame of any sprite animation, you can choose to see any of the preceding or succeeding frames as a semi-transparent layer under the image frame you are currently editing. The great thing about this is that each frame is drawn slightly lighter than the last so you can see how the animation has been progressing from frame to frame while drawing the next one.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Enabling this will show some extra controls over the frames which you can click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21" /> and drag to set the number of preceding frames to show as well as the number of following frames.</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Image Editor Onion Skin" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_OnionSkin.png" />You can set certain properties for onion-skinning from the <strong>View</strong> conext menu, which is explained further down this page.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Beneath the Onion Skin button, you have the <strong>Loop Control</strong> button <img alt="Loop Control Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ImageLoop.png" width="46" /> used to set whether the sprite loops (goes back to frame 1 when the last frame is reached) or ping-pongs (goes backwards through the frames when the last frame is reached). The Play button <img alt="Play Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ImagePlay.png" width="46" /> at the bottom is for starting/stopping the preview of the animation.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">You can click on any frame to select it for editing, and a selected frame will have a Delete button <img alt="Delete Frame Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RemoveFrame.png" /> at the top corner which you can click to remove the frame from the sprite. You can also click <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> + <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21" /> on multiple frames to select them together, in which case clicking the Delete button will delete all the selected frames. Finally, you can use the standard keyboard shortcuts for <em>Cut</em>, <em>Copy </em>and <em>Paste </em>to edit selected frames: <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> + &quot;<span class="inline">X</span>&quot;, <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> + &quot;<span class="inline">C</span>&quot;, and <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> + &quot;<span class="inline">V</span>&quot;.</p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>
  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down1" href="#">Frame Information</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down1">
    <p class="dropspot">This bar contains the <strong>Frame Information</strong>. Here you can set the speed at which the animation frames should be played back using the input box on the left. The frame speed can either be based on &quot;<em>Frames per second</em>&quot;, or &quot;<em>Frames per game frame</em>&quot;. The total number of frames available are shown to the right along with the current frame that has been selected, and you can collapse this bar (hide it) by clicking on the <img alt="Collapse Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Collapse.png" width="20" /> icon to the left. You can set this to always start open or always start closed from the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Image_Editor_Preferences.htm">Image Editor Preferences</a>.</p>
    <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"> </span> The value used here for the animation speed will also set the way the sprite is animated when used in a game, either as a sprite asset on a layer or as a sprite assigned to an instance, although you can modify this at runtime using the appropriate <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprites.htm">functions</a> and <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Instance_Variables/Sprite_Instance_Variables.htm">variables</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down2" href="#">Canvas Controls</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down2">
    <p class="dropspot">The canvas controls deal with various aspects of how the main draw canvas and its contents are displayed. The options are:</p>
    <ul class="dropspotlist">
      <li class="dropspot">Toggle Canvas Grid <img alt="Canvas Grid Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasGrid.png" />: This will toggle on/off the canvas grid. This is a grid that <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> draws over the main canvas to divide it into sections, and by default is set to 1px in size. However if you click the Grid Menu icon <img alt="Grid Options Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasOptions.png" width="10" /> you will open the grid options:<br />
        <img alt="Image Editor Grid Options" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Images_GridOptions.png" />These options permit you to set the grid colour and alpha, as well as the cell values for the grid along the X and Y axis. You also have an option to enable or disable grid snapping here (disabled by default).
      </li>
      <li class="dropspot">Canvas Zoom Controls <img alt="Canvas Zoom Icons" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasZoom.png" width="120" />: These buttons control the current canvas zoom level. You can zoom in or out and clicking the <img alt="Zoom Reset Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ZoomReset.png" /> button will reset the canvas to be 1:1 with the image being edited. You can also click the Window Fit button <img alt="Canvas Fit Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasFit.png" /> to make the entire image canvas fit within the current editor workspace (this will zoom in/out as appropriate to make it fit). Note that you can also zoom in and out using the <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> and the Mouse Wheel <img alt="MMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png" />, and pressing <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> + <img alt="Enter Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Enter.png" width="55" /> will set the room canvas to be 1:1 with the image.</li>
      <li class="dropspot">Split Canvas <img alt="Split Canvas Icons" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasSplit.png" width="88" />: Clicking this will cycle between splitting the canvas horizontally, vertically keeping it a single a single canvas. When in split canvas view, each canvas will have its own set of Canvas controls so you can zoom one in and the other out, for example, and you can edit either canvas with the changes being reflected in the other canvas. To change the canvas view toggle, you can click the Split Options <img alt="Grid Options Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_CanvasOptions.png" width="10" /> button and select the one you wish to use or simply click the Split Canvas button until it cycles to the one you want.</li>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down6">
    <p class="dropspot">The top of this section has a number or predefined colour <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="swatches" href="#">swatches</a> that you can choose from, and they can be assigned to the left <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21" /> and right <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" width="21" /> mouse buttons respectively by clicking on them with either button (you can also swap the colours between each button by clicking the arrow icon in beside the swatches). The colours selected will be shown below as swatches beside the image of the mouse, and you can then click these to open the <strong>Colour Picker</strong> window:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Image Editor Colour Picker" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_ColourPicker.png" />From this window you can define the colour using any of the available sliders and gadgets, or you can input values directly for the <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="ARGB" href="#">ARGB</a> values or <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="HSV" href="#">HSV</a> values.</p>

Clicking &quot;OK&quot; in the colour picker in this case will set the palette to the new colour and save it along with the sprite asset being edited.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">These colour palettes can then be swapped and applied to different sprites using the colour palette <strong>Options </strong>menu:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Image Editor Colour Picker Options" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_ColourPicker_Options.png" /></p>

This section is <em>not</em> copied when using the &quot;Import colours&quot; or &quot;Copy colours&quot; option, as that only applies to the main palette above.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">So, you can create a custom colour palette in a sprite image and then use that to set the palette for any other sprite in the Asset Browser, or you can open a sprite image and import the colour palette from any other sprite in the Asset Browser.

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down8">
    <p class="dropspot">You can create <strong>layers </strong>in the image editor for different parts of your image, and these layers can be manipulated and drawn to using the various brushes and tools. To create a new layer, simply click the <img alt="Add Layer Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Image_Add.png" width="24" /> icon, and to remove it again the <img alt="Remove Layer Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Image_Remove.png" width="24" /> icon. Layers can also be ordered by clicking <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21" /> on a layer and then dragging the layer up or down to the position you require, and you can further organise the layers by creating folders using the <img alt="Add Layer Folder Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Image_Folder.png" width="24" /> button and then dragging layers into them.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">If you double click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21" /> on a layer (or use <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" width="21" /> and select <strong>Edit Layer Properties</strong>) you&#39;ll get access to the Layer Properties window:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Image Editor Layer Properties" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_LayerProperties.png" />Here you can name the layer as well as set the blend mode (the way that it should be &quot;mixed&quot; with the layers beneath), choosing from <em>normal</em>, <em>additive</em>, <em>subtractive </em>or <em>multiply </em>blends. Finally you can set the opacity (transparency) of the layer with a slider, but note that this is cumulative with the actual alpha value of individual pixels - for example, if you have pixels that are 50% opaque and set the layer opacity to 50%, the final pixels will be drawn at 25% opacity.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">You can also paste from your clipboard (<img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> + &quot;<span class="inline">V</span>&quot;) to create a new layer, which can be enabled/disabled in the <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Image_Editor_Preferences.htm">Image Editor Preferences</a> (see &quot;<strong>Image Selection Copy/Paste</strong>&quot;).</p>

  <p>Apart from those tools within the Image Editor itself, there are also a number of extra tools available to you from the Menu Bar at the top of the IDE:</p>
  <p><img alt="Image Editor Menus" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Image_Menus.png" style="margin-top: -20px; margin-bottom: 1px;" />These menus are explained in the sections below:</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down9" href="#">Image</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down9">
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Image Editor Image Menu" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_MenuImages.png" />The Image menu has the following options (some of which may or may not be available depending on the currrent editor focus):</p>
    <ul class="dropspotlist">
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Cut Frame</strong> / <strong>Selection </strong>- Cut the frame or selection from the image, depending on Editor focus. If cutting a selection, this will add it to the brushes.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Copy Frame</strong> / <strong>Selection </strong>- Copy the frame or the selection from the image, depending on Editor focus. If copying a selection, this will add it to the brushes.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Paste Frame</strong> / <strong>Selection </strong>- Paste the frame from the clipboard, or paste the selection from the clipboard to the image, depending on the current focus of the IDE. When pasting into an image, you should note that this option is designed only for use with clipboard data from external programs. When you cut or copy to the clipboard from an image in the Image Editor, this is added to the brushes in the top right of the editor, and you should select a brush to draw with the cut/copied selection rather than try to paste it into the image. Also note that a number of programs will have issues pasting transparencies from the clipboard into <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> image editor due to the format used by the clipboard.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Select All </strong>- Select the full image.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Cancel Selection</strong> - Clear any selection from the image.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Invert Selection</strong> - Invert the current selection.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Add Frame</strong> - Add a new frame to the sprite.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Insert Frame</strong> - Insert a new frame after the one currently showing.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Delete Selected Fames</strong> - Remove the selected frame from the sprite (you can use <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55" /> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55" /> + <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21" /> and/or <img alt="Shift Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png" width="55" /> + <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21" /> to select multiple frames).</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Import Image(s)</strong> - Load an image to be used as a frame from disk. Note that you can load multiple frames at once by selecting multiple individual files to import in the explorer window. Once you have selected your file or files you will be shown the following Import window:<br />
        <img alt="Image Editor Import Window" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Image_Import.png" />Here you can choose how the imported image should be added to the current sprite, permitting you to resize the entire draw canvas, crop or pad it, and also set the &quot;anchor&quot; position for placing the new image(s).
      </li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Convert to Frames</strong> - This option will convert a single image into a number of separate frames. You must first have created a single frame with all the parts of the animation in it (or imported a single strip image) like the one shown below:<br />
        <img alt="Image Editor Animation Strip" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Image_Strip.png" />Since this is a single image and we want to convert it into individual frames, we can use this option which will then open the following window:<br />
        <img alt="Image Editor Convert to Animation Frames" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Image_ConvertStrip.png" />Here you can set how the single image should be split to create the frames, setting the number of frames, the width and height of the frames and any including any offset values.
      </li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Import Strip Image</strong> - This option will open a file explorer and prompt you to look for a single strip image file to be used to create frames from. Once selected an image the Import strip window will open, exactly the same as for the <strong>Convert To Frames</strong> option shown above.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong id="export_to_png">Export to PNG</strong> - Selecting this option will export the sprite as a single <span class="inline">PNG</span> image. If the sprite has more than a single image, then a &quot;strip&quot; sprite will be created with all the images, one after another, and the save file name will automatically be appended with &quot;<span class="inline">_stripX</span>&quot;, where &quot;<span class="inline">X</span>&quot; is the number of frames exported. For example, a five frame sprite will be exported as &quot;<span class="inline">sprite_name_strip5.png</span>&quot;.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Resize All Frames</strong> - When you select this option it will open the following window where you can set the way that you want to resize all the animation frames that comprise the sprite:<br />
        <img alt="Image Editor Resize Frames" class="center" height="409" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Image_ResizeFrames.png" width="590" />You can choose to either <strong>Scale </strong>the image, or to <strong>Resize</strong> the canvas. If you choose to scale the image then you simply select the new width and/or height for each frame, whether to scale using the same aspect ratio, and also whether to scale in pixels or percent. Note that when scaling you can enable <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="linear interpolation" href="#">linear interpolation</a> on or off, where having it on will cause the pixels to blur or &quot;smear&quot; as the image is scaled (in general, for hi resolution art you want this <em>on</em>, but for pixel art you want this <em>off</em>).<br />
        <br />
        The option to resize the canvas will not alter the pixels within the image but instead increase or decrease the size of the canvas that the images are being drawn on. You can set where the &quot;anchor&quot; for the resize should be using the arrow icons, then set the new size (in pixels or as a percentage) as well as set whether to maintain the aspect ratio of the original frames. Note that making the frame smaller than the original sprite images will crop the pixels.
      </li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Crop All Frames To Selection</strong> - This option will only be available when you have an area of the image selected in the main draw canvas. When you then choose this option, the image being edited (and all other frames in the animation) will be cropped to the boundaries of the selection.</li>
      <li class="dropspot" id="auto_trim_all_frames"><strong>Auto Trim All Frames</strong> - This option permits you to trim all the zero-alpha pixels from around the edges of a sprite. This will take into consideration all image frames within the sprite, so each side will crop to the edge of whichever frame has the furthest non-zero alpha pixel.<br />
        <img alt="Image Editor Trim Frames" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Image_Trim.png" />
      </li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Reverse Frames</strong> - Selecting this will simply reverse the frame order for the sprite.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Mirror </strong>- This option permits you to mirror either the current frame all all the frames that comprise the sprite along the vertical axis.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Flip </strong>- This option permits you to flip either the current frame all all the frames that comprise the sprite along the horizontal axis.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Rotate all Frames (clockwise 90°)</strong> - This option will rotate all the frames of the animation 90° clockwise.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Rotate all Frames (anti-clockwise 90°)</strong> - This option will rotate all the frames of the animation 90° anti-clockwise.</li>
